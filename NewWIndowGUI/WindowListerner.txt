1.frame.addWindowListener(...);: This line adds a WindowListener to the frame (frame). 
A WindowListener is an interface that listens for events related to a window, 
such as opening, closing, or resizing.

2.new java.awt.event.WindowAdapter() { ... }: 
This creates an instance of an anonymous inner class that extends WindowAdapter, 
which is an abstract class implementing the WindowListener interface. 
By using an anonymous inner class, you can define and instantiate the WindowAdapter subclass in one step.

3.@Override public void windowClosing(java.awt.event.WindowEvent windowEvent) { ... }: 
This overrides the windowClosing method of WindowAdapter. 
This method is called when the window is in the process of being closed,
typically because the user clicked the "X" button in the window's title bar.

4.exitApplication();: This calls the exitApplication() method defined in the outer class (LaunchPageDemo). 
When the window closing event occurs (i.e., the user clicks the "X" button to close the window), 
this method is called, and exitApplication() is invoked,
which sets the default close operation to EXIT_ON_CLOSE and disposes of the frame, 
effectively closing the application.

In summary, this part of the code adds a WindowListener to the frame that listens for the window closing event.
When the window closing event occurs, it calls the exitApplication() method, 
which ensures that the application is properly closed by setting the appropriate default close operation and disposing of the frame.
